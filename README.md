# StackCoordinator
StackCoordinator is a lightweight library that enables the use of the coordinator pattern in SwiftUI applications.

## Overview
The coordinator pattern is a design pattern commonly used in applications to handle navigation, dependency injection, and communication between different views and components. StackCoordinator provides a set of protocols and base classes that make it easy to implement the Coordinator pattern in your SwiftUI projects. This library was inspired by the ideas and concepts found in the [FlowCoordinators-SwiftUI-iOS16 repository](https://github.com/michzio/FlowCoordinators-SwiftUI-iOS16), which has been a valuable resource in the development of StackCoordinator.
